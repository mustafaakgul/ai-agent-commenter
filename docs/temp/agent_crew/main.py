# The Crew class orchestrates the collaboration of multiple agents and tasks, enabling the execution of complex workflows
# Agents: A list of Agent instances that define the roles and responsibilities within the crew.
# Tasks: A list of Task instances that outline the specific actions to be executed.
# Process Flow: Determines the execution strategy of tasks, such as sequential or hierarchical processes.
# Verbose Mode: Enables detailed logging of the crewâ€™s operations for monitoring and debugging purposes.

# Decorators: In CrewAI, decorators like @agent, @task, and @crew are used to define agents, tasks, and crews directly
# within a class that extends CrewBase. These decorators automatically register the components for the workflow.

# @agent: Defines an agent with specific configurations.

"""
How It Works
The decorators link logic and configurations (from YAML or inline) to the CrewAI framework.
They simplify workflow creation by automatically registering the components in the CrewBase class.
By using these decorators, you can organize and manage agents, tasks, and crews efficiently in a modular way.
